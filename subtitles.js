// There used to be a graying tower alone on the sea.
// You became the light on the dark side of me.
// Love remained a drug that's the high and not the pill.
// But did you know,
// That when it snows,
// My eyes become large and
// The light that you shine can be seen.
// Baby,
// I compare you to a kiss from a rose on the gray.
// Ooh,
// The more I get of you,
// The stranger it feels, yeah.
// And now that your rose is in bloom.
// A light hits the gloom on the gray.
// There is so much a man can tell you,
// So much he can say.
// You remain,
// My power, my pleasure, my pain, baby
// To me you're like a growing addiction that I can't deny.
// Won't you tell me is that healthy, baby?
// But did you know,
// That when it snows,
// My eyes become large and the light that you shine can be seen.
// Baby,
// I compare you to a kiss from a rose on the gray.
// Ooh, the more I get of you
// The stranger it feels, yeah
// Now that your rose is in bloom.
// A light hits the gloom on the gray,
// I've been kissed by a rose on the gray,
// I've been kissed by a rose
// I've been kissed by a rose on the gray,
// ...And if I should fall along the way
// I've been kissed by a rose
// ...been kissed by a rose on the gray.
// There is so much a man can tell you,
// So much he can say.
// You remain
// My power, my pleasure, my pain.
// To me you're like a growing addiction that I can't deny, yeah
// Won't you tell me is that healthy, baby.
// But did you know,
// That when it snows,

// Baby,
// I compare you to a kiss from a rose on the gray.
// Ooh, the more I get of you
// The stranger it feels, yeah
// Now that your rose is in bloom,
// A light hits the gloom on the gray.
// Yes I compare you to a kiss from a rose on the gray
// Ooh, the more I get of you
// The stranger it feels, yeah
// And now that your rose is in bloom
// A light hits the gloom on the gray
// Now that your rose is in bloom,
// A light hits the gloom on the gray.
